# Brief Explanation:

## Why Splinter?

Splinter is a wrapper for Selenium that allows for an extension of the automation while also reducing the amount of code needed to produce the same results.

I highly recommend Splinter do to its straight forward documentation and ease of use with beautifulsoup4.
This combination of scraping software is my go-to team when I need to scrape digital information from websites.

# Demonstration:

Just to be safe, I'm including a video demonstration of the Scripting Logic to show how Splinter works in conjunction with BS4.
